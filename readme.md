proposal for open source community combat(flight, possibly other) simulator



project scope:
- some way for 3rd party developers to profit off of making high quality modules vetted by the project team.


scope of gameplay:
- multiplayer pvpve, multiplatform, PtP multicrew avoiding RTT of server
- realistic SAMs like real IADS for functional SEAD/DEAD (similar to skynet, able to hide, network, coordinate with interceptors and awacs)
- realistic bvr
- realistic emulation (not simulation) of radar systems (prebaked RCS, not realtime ray casts)
- realistic weapons


scope of modules:
- full fidelity clickable, bindable, vr interactable cockpits
- varied levels of fidelity for things like FM, ?


scope of engine:
- user login for module ownership of 3rd party modules
- 60fps minimum for moderate hardware, ideally 100fps+
- culling for distance optimization
